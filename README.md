# CS50 AI Course Projects

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the projects in the CS50 AI course offered by edX. Each project focuses on various aspects of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer science concepts.

## Project List

1. [Project 0: Search](https://github.com/Dhvanil-CSE/cs50-AI-edx/tree/main/Project%200%3A%20Search)
   - Implement various search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A* search) to solve problems.
   - Explore problem-solving strategies in a search space.

2. [Project 1: Knowledge](https://github.com/Dhvanil-CSE/cs50-AI-edx/tree/main/Project%201:Knowledge)
   - Build a knowledge base and inference engine using propositional logic.
   - Implement the resolution inference algorithm.

3. [Project 2: Language](project2/README.md)
   - Create a model for natural language processing tasks.
   - Implement sentiment analysis and part-of-speech tagging.

4. [Project 3: Speech](project3/README.md)
   - Develop a speech recognition system.
   - Implement Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for speech recognition.

5. [Project 4: Learning](project4/README.md)
   - Implement a machine learning model for a given dataset.
   - Apply supervised learning and evaluate model performance.

6. [Project 5: Neural Networks](project5/README.md)
   - Build and train deep neural networks.
   - Solve problems in computer vision and natural language processing.

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains detailed instructions, code templates, and example datasets (if applicable). Follow the instructions in the respective project READMEs to get started with each project.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Required Python libraries (listed in each project's README)

## Usage

You can run the project code by following the instructions provided in each project's README. Typically, you can run the main program using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
