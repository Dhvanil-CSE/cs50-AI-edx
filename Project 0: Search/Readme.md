# Project 0: Search

This is Project 0 for the CS50 AI course on edX, focusing on implementing various search algorithms and exploring problem-solving strategies in a search space.

## Description

In this project, I have implemented various search algorithms to solve problems in a search space. The main objective is to explore different search strategies and understand their performance characteristics in solving a variety of problems.

The project covers the following topics:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- A* Search Algorithm

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cs50-ai-project0.git
